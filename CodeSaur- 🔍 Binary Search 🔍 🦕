🔍 BINARY SEARCH 🔍

This algorithm is akin to a conversation, like a riddle game. The binary search is more effective than a linear search.
WHY? 
I'll provide an example.

My university has numerous students, and I aim to find the best computer science student. However, I have extensive records for many individuals. I begin with the name of the career (Computer Science) as my starting point. 
I'll search among the computer science students, but I only possess the ID for this individual. Once I have isolated the computer science students, I'll commence searching by ID. However, in our records, we have 2,000 students. 
Doing a linear search in this scenario is quite cumbersome.

Therefore, it's similar to using a dictionary because I know the ID of the best computer science student is 1,290.

Is this student in the range of 1 to 1,000?
No.

Is this student in the range of 1,400 to 2,000?
No.

Is this student in the range of 1,200 to 1,300?
Yes.

I know this is a stupid definition but like this its more simple to understand.
