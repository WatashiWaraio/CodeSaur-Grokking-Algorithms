# CodeSaur-Grokking-Algorithms 🦕🦕

Alright, this repository tracks my journey through Aditya Y. Bhargava's book 📖, 'Grokking Algorithms.' I'm eager to wrap my head 🤯 around basic algorithms, so I'm coding them up in Python. 
But before diving into that, let me give you a quick lowdown on what this book's all about. Ready to join me on this adventure into the world of algorithms and code?

**GROKKING ALGORITHMS BY ADITYA Y. BHARGAVA**
This book is especially designed for novices and curious individuals. It's easy to understand as it simplifies technical expressions. Within this book, you'll find basic programming algorithms 
like Binary Search, Big O notation, Selection Sort, and many more. Don't worry if those sound unfamiliar I can showcase my own application within this repository.

 *⚠️ ATTENTION ⚠️*

If you're truly interested in delving into this book 📓, I highly recommend it. It's incredibly fascinating. This repository isn't a summary of the book; 
it serves as my guide to developing algorithms myself. Here, Im to provide concise explanations of these algorithms. 
My primary goal is to learn 🧠 by creating this repository and sharing it 🦈, especially because I'm not very familiar 🍾 with these patterns or algorithms.
